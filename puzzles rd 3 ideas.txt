One where you have to set the accurate time
One where you have to zoom out to see the whole puzzle ('Look! A to-scale ant!')
One where there's a piano, which plays notes on click. There are things in the room like cabbage, ABBA, badge, beg, beach, etc.
Each thing has a number, and you gotta play the things in that order. Playing them lights up something to show progress I think.
Hacking level? Idk sounds funny though.
An early level is a city kind of vibe. Gotta drag a bus/truck out the way to get the answer. only when light is green??
An elevator level where the music corresponds to the buttons you press. Gotta press them in the right order.

Need to think of theme, asthetic, and story before we start I think.
